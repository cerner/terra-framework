# Terra Tabs

Tabs are containers used to organize content. They allow for quick switching between groups of contextually related content. Content is divided into different containers and each container is viewable one at a time. The user can switch between containers by selecting the corresponding tab control.

Tabs are meant to organize content as to provide quick access to a group of contextually related content that does not need to be compared or accessed simultaneously. Tabs are not intended for navigation.

## Getting Started

- Install with [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com):
  - `npm install terra-tabs`

## Usage

### Note
The tabs component will apply the prop `isLabelHidden` to all components passed as content for Tabs.Pane. This will indicate if any of the tabs are icon only or have been truncated. When this prop is true a header should be rendered in the content area to for accessibility purposes.

### Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Tabs

Terra-tabs allows you to use either a controlled or uncontrolled mode in order to have the amount control over the state that you need.

### Uncontrolled Tabs

Uncontrolled tabs is the default mode of terra-tabs. In this mode the tabs will handle all state internally and the initial active tab can optionally be set using `defaultActiveKey` on the `<Tabs />` component.

### Controlled Tabs

In controlled mode terra-tabs does not handle any of the selection state internally, it is left up to the consumer. This mode is enabled by setting the `activeKey` prop on the `<Tabs />` component. A handler is needed for `onChange` to be notified of user selection and update the state. If both `activeKey` and `defaultActiveKey` are set, then `defaultActiveKey` will have no effect.

```jsx
import Tabs from 'terra-tabs';
```
