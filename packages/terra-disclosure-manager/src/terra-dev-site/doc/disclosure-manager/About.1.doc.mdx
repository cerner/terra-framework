# Terra Disclosure Manager

The DisclosureManager is a stateful component used to manage disclosure presentation. It provides consumers with access to the `DisclosureManager` component, the `DisclosureManagerContext`, and the context wrapper `withDisclosureManager`. Additionally, it provides the `DisclosureManagerHeaderAdapter` to allow disclosed content to register header information with the disclosing container.

For the purpose of clarity, the concepts explained can be broken down into:
- Disclosure Manager
- Disclosure Manager Children - content rendered as children of the DisclosureManager
- Disclosed Content - content that will be disclosed by a DisclosureManager child

## Getting Started

- Install with [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com):
  - `npm install terra-disclosure-manager`

## Peer Dependencies

This component requires the following peer dependencies be installed in your app for the component to properly function.

| Peer Dependency | Version |
|-|-|
| react | ^16.8.5 |
| react-dom | ^16.8.5 |

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

This package uses React's Context for inter-component communication. A single instance of this package must be installed to ensure that communication occurs between all Context Providers and Consumers. To help ensure a single instance is installed, this package should be defined as a peer dependency in packages that are reusable libraries or otherwise consumed by other packages.

## Usage
```js
import DisclosureManager from 'terra-disclosure-manager';
```

## Disclosure Manager Props
<DisclosureManagerPropsTable />

### Requirements of the Render Prop 

The DisclosureManager does not implement a traditional render function. Instead, it uses the `render` prop provided to the DisclosureManager to allow the implementing component to managed how disclsoures should be presented. The `render` function should define the following parameters that will reflect the the DisclosureManager's state.

```js
const render = ({
  children,
  closeDisclosure,
  disclosureComponentKeys,
  disclosureComponentData,
  disclosure,
  dismissPresentedComponent,
  maximizeDisclosure,
  minimizeDisclosure,
}) => {
  // render stuff
};
```

const render = ({
  /* The children components provided to the DisclosureManager. */
  children: {
    /* Array of React components to render as content. */
