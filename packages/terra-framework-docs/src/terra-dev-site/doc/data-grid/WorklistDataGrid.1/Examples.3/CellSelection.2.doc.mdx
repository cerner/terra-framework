# Cell Selection

### Description
This example demonstrates a [Worklist Data Grid](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/data-grid/worklist-data-grid/about) that has support for cell selection.
A cell is selected by clicking on the cell or pressing the Spacebar on the focused
cell. Only cells that are selectable and not masked can be selected.
A cell is selectable by default.

### Properties required
* The **onCellSelect** callback prop: When the user selects a cell, this callback will be called with the rowId and ColumnId of the selected cell.
In this example, the information is used to look up the matching cell information in the consumer data and disclose additional information for that cell. Also, the _selected_ attribute of the matching cell in the row data is toggled but a consumer may chose to do nothing when the cell is already selected. Since only one cell may be selected, any previous cell selection is cleared before a new cell is selected.


* The **onClearSelectedCells** callback prop: When the user presses Escape, this callback gets called. In this example, the selected attribute of any selected cell is set to false and the Worklist Data Grid is re-rendered.
