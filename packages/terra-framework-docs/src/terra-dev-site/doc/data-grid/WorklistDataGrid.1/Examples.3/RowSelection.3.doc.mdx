# Row Selection

### Description
The [Worklist Data Grid](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/data-grid/worklist-data-grid/about) is built to operate in either of two selection modes:
* Cell Selection (_default_)
* **Row Selection**

Row Selection Mode is controlled via a prop and is off by default.
When creating a Worklist Data Grid that supports Row Selection, the prop has to be explicitly set by the consumer.
This example demonstrates a Worklist Data Grid with full support for row selection and can be referenced for [row centric functionalities](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/data-grid/worklist-data-grid/examples/row-selection#implemented-functionality).

### Properties required
This example demonstrates a Worklist Data Grid with full support for row selection by utilizing the following [Worklist Data Grid properties](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/data-grid/worklist-data-grid/about#properties):
* hasSelectableRows
* onRowSelect
* onRowSelectAll
* onClearSelectedRows
* onDisableSelectableRows
* onEnableRowSelection
