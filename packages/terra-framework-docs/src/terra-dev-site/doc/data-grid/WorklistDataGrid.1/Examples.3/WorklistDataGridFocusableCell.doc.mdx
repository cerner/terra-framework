# Single Cell Navigation (Dive-In)

### Description

The content of a cell in the [Worklist Data Grid](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/data-grid/worklist-data-grid/about) may be empty, text, numerical, or any combination of widgets.
Since the [grid pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/grid/) mandates only one tab stop and arrow keys for navigation, these keys are not available by default to navigate focusable elements inside a cell.
To make these keys available for cell navigation as part of its basic functionality, the Worklist Data Grid supports single cell navigation (dive-in mode).
Enabling single cell navigation will disable grid navigation and disabling single cell navigation will restore grid navigation.

<b>Notes</b>
<ul>
  <li><em>Single Cell navigation is built-in and does not require any additional setup or implementation.</em></li>
  <li><em>Cells which contain only a focusable button or hyperlink will focus on those components directly without needing to dive into the cell.</em></li>
</ul>
</span>
