# Column States and Selection
<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="2">
Please note that JAWS will not announce a change in sort order when using the Edge or Chrome browsers. 
</Notice>

### Description
This example demonstrates a [Worklist Data Grid](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/data-grid/worklist-data-grid/about) that supports column states and selection.
A column can be selected by clicking on the column or pressing the Spacebar on the focused column.
Only columns that are selectable can be selected. A column is selectable by default.

The Column can display icons representing its current state such as sort indicator and error.

### Properties required
* The **_onColumnSelect_** callback prop: When the user selects a column, this callback will be called with the columnId of the selected column.

The below example also demonstrates how properties such as _isSelectable_, _hasError_ and _sortIndicator_ can be provided by the consumer to prevent selection, display error and show sort indicator icons respectively.
