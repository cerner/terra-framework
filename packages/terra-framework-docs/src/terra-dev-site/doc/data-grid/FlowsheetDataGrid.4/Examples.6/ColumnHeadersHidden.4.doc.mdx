# Hiding Column Headers

### Description
The [Flowsheet Data Grid](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/data-grid/flowsheet-data-grid/about) can hide column headers with the `hasVisibleColumnHeaders` prop.

### Usage
The `hasVisibleColumns` is a boolean. By default, it is set to `true`.
When it is set to `false`, the column headers are hidden, but still exist in the DOM and can be read by screenreaders when providing context for the table.
This is useful when needing to use custom alternative to column headers, such as Stella Timeline.

**Note:**
- Column header labels should still be provided in the dataset to ensure that sceenreaders will still read out the appropriate context for the table.
- When using custom column headers, then logic must be added to ensure that the column widths match are in sync if resizing columns are enabled.
The [width](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/data-grid/flowsheet-data-grid/about#column) property of columns can be used to control the Flowsheet Data Grid column widths.
