# Row Selection

### Description
This example demonstrates a Flowsheet Data Grid with row selection support by utilizing the following [properties](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/data-grid/flowsheet-data-grid/about#properties):

* The **onRowSelect** callback prop: When the user selects a row header cell (a cell in the pinned first column), this callback will be called with the `rowId` of the selected row.
In this example, the `isSelected` row property is toggled to true, adding highlighting to the selected row.
