# Basic Folder Tree

### Description

The following example demonstrates a basic folder tree. For more details on specific folder tree
features, see the following examples:
* [Selection](./folder-tree-selection)
* [Expand/Collapse](./folder-tree-expand-collapse)
* [Expand/Collapse All](./folder-tree-expand-collapse-all)

A folder tree is composed of two components:
* **[FolderTree](../about#foldertree-props-table)**: The top-level folder tree component.
* **[FolderTree.Item](../about#foldertreeitem-props-table)**: A row in a folder tree that may have `subfolderItems`.
  * If there are 1 or more `subfolderItems`, the row will be expandable/collapsible and display a folder icon.

All children of a FolderTree **must** be FolderTreeItems.

### Required Properties

The following FolderTree props are required for a basic folder tree:
* **[title](../about#foldertree-props-table)**: The title of the folder tree. This is also used as the `aria-label` for the folder tree.

The following FolderTree.Item props are required for a basic folder tree:
* **[label](../about#foldertreeitem-props-table)**: The text label for the folder tree item.

```js
<FolderTree
  title="Documents"
>
  <FolderTree.Item label="First Item" />
  <FolderTree.Item label="Second Item" />
  <FolderTree.Item label="Third Item" />
</FolderTree>
```
