# Basic Folder Tree

### Description

The following example demonstrates a basic folder tree. For more details on specific folder tree
features, see the following examples:
* [Selection](./folder-tree-selection)
* [Expand/Collapse](./folder-tree-expand-collapse)
* [Expand/Collapse All](./folder-tree-expand-collapse-all)

A folder tree is composed of two components:
* **FolderTree**: The top-level folder tree component.
* **FolderTreeItem**: A row in a folder tree that may have `subfolderItems`.
  * If there are 1 or more `subfolderItems`, the row will be expandable/collapsible and display a folder icon.

All children of a FolderTree **must** be FolderTreeItems.
