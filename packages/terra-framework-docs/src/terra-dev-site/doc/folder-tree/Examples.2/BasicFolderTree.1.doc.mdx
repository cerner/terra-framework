# Basic Folder Tree

### Description

The example below demonstrates a basic folder tree. For more details on specific folder tree
features, see the following examples:
* [Selection](./folder-tree-selection)
* [Expand and Collapse](./folder-tree-expand-collapse)
* [Expand and Collapse All](./folder-tree-expand-collapse-all)

A folder tree is composed of the following components:
* **[FolderTree](../about#foldertree-props-table)**: The top-level folder tree component.
* **[FolderTree.Item](../about#foldertreeitem-props-table)**: A row in a folder tree that may have `subfolderItems`.
  * If one or more `subfolderItems` exist, a folder icon is displayed for the row, which you can expand and collapse.

All children of a FolderTree must be FolderTree.Items.

### Required Properties

The [title](../about#foldertree-props-table) FolderTree property is required for a basic folder tree. 
This property is the title of the folder tree and also used as the `aria-label` for the folder tree.

The [label](../about#foldertreeitem-props-table) FolderTree.Item property is required for a basic folder tree.
This property is the text label for the folder tree item.

```js
<FolderTree
  title="Documents"
>
  <FolderTree.Item label="First Item" />
  <FolderTree.Item label="Second Item" />
  <FolderTree.Item label="Third Item" />
</FolderTree>
```

<BasicFolderTree />
