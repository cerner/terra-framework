## Overview
The Folder Tree component is an accessible [tree view](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/) that allows the user to navigate a folder structure in a hierarchical view of collapsible, nested rows.

The Folder Tree component displays an action header containing the title of the folder tree, a toolbar
with buttons to expand or collapse all items in the folder tree, and zero or more rows that
may include nested subrows.
The tree part of the component contains only one tab stop and the arrow keys are used for primary navigation.
See [Keyboard Interactions](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/folder-tree/about#keyboard-interactions) for all supported keys.

### Features

  * [Keyboard Navigation](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/folder-tree/about#keyboard-interactions)
  * [Selection](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/folder-tree/examples/folder-tree-selection)
  * [Expand and Collapse](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/folder-tree/examples/folder-tree-expand-collapse)
  * [Expand and Collapse All](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/folder-tree/examples/folder-tree-expand-collapse-all)

## Design Decisions

The Folder Tree component does not manage the state of consumer data. The consumer must manage the expanded, collapsed, and selection state of rows.

## Examples

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Interactions

The Folder Tree component supports the following keyboard interactions based on the [tree view keyboard interactions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/#keyboardinteraction) outlined by the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG):

|Keys |Description|
|---|---|
|RIGHT ARROW       | <ul><li>When a collapsed row is active, the items expand, and the active row does not change.</li><li>When an expanded row is active, the first subrow becomes active.</li><li>When a row with no subrows is active, no action is performed.</li></ul>|
|LEFT ARROW       | <ul><li>When an expanded row is active, the items collapse.</li><li>When a collapsed subrow or a subrow with no further nested items is active, the main row becomes active.</li><li>When a collapsed row with subrows is active, no action is performed.</li></ul>|
|DOWN ARROW       | Selects the row below the currently active row without expanding or collapsing any items. |
|UP ARROW          | Selects the row above the currently active row without expanding or collapsing any items. |
|HOME (Microsoft Windows)<br/>or<br/>COMMAND + LEFT ARROW (Apple Mac)| Selects the first row in the tree without expanding or collapsing any items. |
|END (Microsoft Windows)<br/>or<br/>COMMAND + RIGHT ARROW (Apple Mac)| Selects the last row in the tree without expanding any items. |
|ENTER             | Performs the default action of the currently active row. For main rows, items are expanded or collapsed. In single select trees, if the row has no nested items, the current item is selected if not already selected by default.|

### Assistive Technology Support

#### WAI ARIA Roles and States

* [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label)
  * The value of the `title` property is used as the `aria-label` for the folder tree.

## Implementation

### Installation

Install with [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com):
`npm install terra-folder-tree`

### Dependencies

#### Peer Dependencies

Ensure that the following peer dependencies are installed in your application for the component to properly function:

| Peer Dependency | Version |
|-|-|
| react | ^16.8.5 |
| react-dom | ^16.8.5 |
| react-intl | ^2.8.0 |

## Terra Standards

 * [Cross-Browser Support](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/about/terra-ui/component-standards#cross-browser-support)
 * [Mobile Support](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/about/terra-ui/component-standards#mobile-support)
 * [Internationalization Support](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/about/terra-ui/component-standards#internationalization-i18n)
 * [LTR/RTL Support](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/about/terra-ui/component-standards#ltr--rtl)

## Testing

The Folder Tree component uses `uuid`, which changes the component's description ID dynamically. To mock the return value with the Jest testing library, you can use `jest.spyOn`.

If you are using Enzyme `shallow` rendering for the tests, then the mock may not be required. However, if `mount` is used, then `uuid` should be mocked as shown in the following example:

```js
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

let mockSpyUuid;

// using a variable may result in failures. For best results, mock return value.
beforeAll(() => {
  mockSpyUuid = jest.spyOn(uuidv4, 'v4').mockReturnValue('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000');
});

// restore the mock
afterAll(() => {
  mockSpyUuid.mockRestore();
});

```
