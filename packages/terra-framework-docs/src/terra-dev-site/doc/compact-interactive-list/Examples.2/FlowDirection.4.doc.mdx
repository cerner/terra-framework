# Flow direction options

### Vertical flow

By default the items in the [Compact Interactive List](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about) go from top to bottom before breaking into a new visual column:

<VerticalFlow />

#### Usage

* The list items needs the `rowHeight` property to be explicitly set for the vertical flow. If not set by user, the `rowHeight` property would take the default value.
* The items will be distributed evenly between the first rows, with empty spaces placed in the last column. 
* The user must monitor the `numberOfColumns` prop. If the number of list items can be divided by the `numberOfColumns - 1` without the reminder, it can lead to an empty last column.   

### Horizontal flow

Use `flowHorizontally` prop to change the direction. Items will go from left to right before breaking into a new line:

<HorizontalFlow />

#### Usage

* The horizontal flow does not need the `rowHeight` property to be set.
* All empty spaces will be distributed in the last column, which means that any `numberOfColumns` is allowed.
