# Flow Direction

### Vertical Flow

By default the items in the [Compact Interactive List](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about) go from top to bottom before breaking into a new visual column.

<VerticalFlow />

#### Usage

* The list items needs the [_rowHeight_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) property to be explicitly set for the vertical flow. If not set by user, the default value will be used.
* The items will be distributed evenly between all the columns but the last one. The last column will accommodate the reminder after the number of items was divided by number of columns.
* The user must monitor that the number of rows is not divisible by [_numberOfColumns_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) - 1 without a reminder, as it will lead to an empty last column.

### Horizontal Flow

The [_flowHorizontally_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) prop set to `true` changes the flow direction to go from left to right before breaking into a new line.

<HorizontalFlow />

#### Usage

* The horizontal flow does not require the [_rowHeight_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) property to be set.
* All empty spaces will be distributed in the last row.
