# Flow Direction

### Vertical Flow

By default, the items in the [Compact Interactive List](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about) component are read from top to bottom before moving to a new visual column.

<VerticalFlow />

### Horizontal Flow

If the [flowHorizontally](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) property is set to **true**, the flow direction changes to read from left to right before moving to a new line. *This isn't a common way to use this component and is not recommended for most purposes.*

<HorizontalFlow />
