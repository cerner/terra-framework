# Compact Interactive List taking full width of the container.

### Description

The second column in this Compact Interactive List has prop `flexGrow: true` which allows it to grow.

If the resize observer is attached to the wrapper component to controll the `numberOfColumns` prop, it gives us a flexible number of columns with rezilient width (not attached yet).

Please note that there is no control of `minWidth` of the column yet (work in progress!!!)
