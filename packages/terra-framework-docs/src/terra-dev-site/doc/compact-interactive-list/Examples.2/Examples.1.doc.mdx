# Compact Interactive List examples

## Fix width columns

In this example all semantic columns have `width` set to a number of pixels. 

* The semantic columns (and hence the visual columns) will always stay the same width and would not grow bigger or shrink to fill up the container width.
* If the screen width is less than the list container, the horizontal scroll will be added.

<FixedWidthColumns />

## Responsive columns

There are two ways to make a sematic column grow:

*  Omitting the `width` in column props will make the semantic column grow to take all available space.
*  Setting the `flexGrow` prop to true with the `width` set to a number of units ('px', 'em', or 'rem') will also make the column flex growing. In this case the width will be used as a flex basis.

In the following example the middle column has `flexGrow: true` which allows it to grow to take all width:

<ResponsiveColumns />

To control the minimum and maximum width of flexible width columns, the maximumWidth/minimumWidth prop can be determined for each column separately, or passed as a prop to the whole component.
In following example the middle column has `maximumWidth: 300px` and `minimumWidth: 100px`.

* Once the minimum width has been reached, the horisontal scroll would show up.
* Once the maximum width has been reached, the row stops growing.

## Use width breakpoints fo dinamically adjust the number of columns to the screen width

Another way to control the `CompactInteractiveList` column width is to make its parent component take charge of the number of list columns.

## Use scalable units

The `widthUnit` prop determines the width unit type, such as 'px', 'em', or 'rem'. 
Check out the example below to see how the same list looks like when placed within a container with regular font size vs container with the font size set to 1.25 em if the widthUnit prop is set to em:
