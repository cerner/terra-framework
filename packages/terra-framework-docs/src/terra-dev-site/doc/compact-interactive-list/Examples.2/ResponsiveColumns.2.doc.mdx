# Responsive Columns

### Description

This example demonstrates a [Compact Interactive List](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about) with responsive columns.

* The middle semantic column with the text information has `flexGrow` prop set to `true` which allowes it to grow to fill up container's width.
* The maximum width for the text column is not limited, the minimum width would take the default value.
* Once the list reaches its minimum width, defined by fixed width columns and the default minimum width of the flex growing column, the scroll shows up.

<ResponsiveColumns />

### Usage

There are two ways to make a sematic column responsive:

*  Omitting the `width` in column props will make the semantic column grow to take all available space.
*  Setting the `flexGrow` prop to true with the `width` set to a number of width units (such as `px`, `em`, or `rem`) will also make the column size responsive. In this case the width will be used as a flex basis.

#### Controlling maximum and minimum width with props

* To control the minimum and maximum width of all flexible columns in the component, `columnMaximumWidth` and `columnMinimumWidth` props can be passed to the Compact Interactive List. 
* If `columnMinimumWidth` prop hasn't been set, the default value will be used.
* Alternatively, the `minimumWidth` prop can be passed individually to the desired columns. 

In following example the text column has `maximumWidth: 400px` and `minimumWidth: 200px`:
