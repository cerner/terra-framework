# Fixed Width Columns

### Description

This example demonstrates a [Compact Interactive List](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about) component that renders a collection of interactive information in a list format that has a single tab stop. 

* The [numberOfColumns](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) property is set to **2** to arrange the list in two visual columns.
* Each visual column has three semantic columns, such as an icon, a text description, and an interactive element column.
* All semantic columns have the [width](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#column) property explicitly set, with the [flexGrow](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#column) property omitted. The columns keep their width and do not expand or shrink.
* A horizontal scrollbar is displayed if the screen width is less than the width of the list.
* The list is one-tab stop. You can move focus between cells with the arrow keys or by clicking cells. Click the interactive element or use the arrow keys and press the **SPACEBAR** to change the element's state. Press the **ESC** key while in the list to clear all selected items.
