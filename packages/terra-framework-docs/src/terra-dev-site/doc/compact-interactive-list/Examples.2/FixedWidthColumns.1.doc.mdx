# Fixed Width Columns

### Description

This example demonstrates a [Compact Interactive List](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about) which renders a collection of interactive data in a list format into a single tab stop. 

* The list is arranged in 2 visual columns by the [_numberOfColumns_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) prop set to `2`.
* Each visual column consists of 3 semantic columns, such as Icon, Text Description, and an interactive Featured column.
* All semantic columns have [_width_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#column) prop explicitly set, with the [_flexGrow_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#column) prop omitted. The columns will keep their width and not grow wider or shrink.
* Horizontal scroll will show up if screen width is less than the width of the list.
* The list is a one tab stop. The user can navigate between cells with the arrow keys. **Space key** press or mouse click on the Featured cell will toggle their state. **Esc key** press while on the list would unselect all featured items.
