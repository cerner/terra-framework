# Fixed Width Columns

### Description

This example demonstrates a [Compact Interactive List](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about) which renders a collection of interactive data in a list format into a single tab stop. 

* The list is arranged in 2 visual columns, and each visual column consists of 3 semantic columns, such as an icon, the text description, and the featured icon.
* All semantic columns have width prop explicitly set to a number, so that they will not grow wider or shrink to fill up the container.
* Horizontal scroll will show up if screen width is less than the width of the list.
* The user can navigate between cells with the arrow keys.
