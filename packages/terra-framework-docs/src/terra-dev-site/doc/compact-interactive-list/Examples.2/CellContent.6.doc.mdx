# Cell Content and Cell Selection

### Cell Content
<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="3">

* Only one interactive element per cell is allowed. Because the Compact Intercative List component is one tab stop and the arrow keys are used to move between cells, these keys are not available to move to multiple interactive elements in a cell. 
* Interactive elements are limited to [terra-button](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/components/cerner-terra-core-docs/button/about) and [terra-hyperlink](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/components/cerner-terra-core-docs/hyperlink/about). Currently, the cell does not restrict interaction when active, 
and all interactive elements keep their native arrow key interactions. If you place a text input, a text area, or select elements in a cell, you are unable to move away from the cell with the arrow keys. 

</Notice>

* The [content](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#cell) of a cell in the [Compact Interactive List](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about) component may be empty, text, numerical, or any combination of widgets, but only one interactive element per cell is allowed.
* If a cell contains an interactive element, the interactive element becomes active when you select the cell. 
* If you press an arrow key when a cell is active, the next or previous cell becomes active.

### Cell Selection

The example below demonstrates a [Compact Interactive List](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about) component that supports cell selection. 

* You can click a cell or press the **SPACERBAR** on the active cell to select it. 
* A cell is selectable unless it contains an interactive element, in which case the interactive element default controls apply, or **[isSelectable](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#column) prop** is set to `false` for the corresponding column.

#### Required Properties

* **[onCellSelect](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) callback property:** When the user selects a cell, this callback requests the object with the rowId and columnId properties of the selected cell. 
* **[onClearSelectedCells](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) callback property:** When the user presses the **ESC** key, this callback is requested.
