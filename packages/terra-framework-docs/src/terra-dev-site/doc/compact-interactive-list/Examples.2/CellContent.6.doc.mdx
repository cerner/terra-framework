# Cell content and cell selection

### Cell content

* The [_content_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#cell) of a cell in the [Compact Interactive List](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about) may be empty, text, numerical, or any combination of widgets, but only one focusable element per cell is allowed. 
  Since Compact Intercative List is one tab stop and arrow keys are used for navigation between cells, these keys are not available to navigate multiple focusable elements inside a cell. 
* If a cell contains a focusable element inside of it, when navigated to the cell via arrow keys or mouse click, the focusable element will get the focus. 
* The arrow key press when focused on a cell will navigate away from that cell to the new cell located in corresponding direction.

### Cell selection

This example demonstrates a [Compact Interactive List](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about) that has support for cell selection. 

* A cell is selected by clicking on the cell or pressing the Spacebar on the focused cell. 
* A cell is selectable unless it contains an interactable element, in that case the interactive element default controls apply.

#### Properties required

* The [_onCellSelect_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) callback prop: When the user selects a cell, this callback will be called with the object with `rowId` and `columnId` props of a selected cell. 
* The [_onClearSelectedCells_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) callback prop: When the user presses the **Escape key**, this callback gets called.
