## Overview
<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="2">
The Terra Compact Interactive List component is currently under alpha release. Breaking changes can occur between releases until it is stable with the 1.0 release.
</Notice>

The Terra Compact Interactive List component provides a way to render a collection of interactive information in a list format that has a single tab stop. You can arrange the list in columns to fit a wide space, and the user can move between them with the arrow keys.

<FixedWidthColumns />

### Features
* Ability to arrange items in columns.
* Fixed and responsive width columns.
* `px`, `em`, and `rem` width units.
* Vertical and horizontal flow.
* Minimum and maximum column widths that you can set for all responsive columns or for each column individually.
* Selectable cells.
* Interactive elements in cells (one per cell).

See the [Examples](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#examples) section for detailed demonstrations of the Compact Interactive List component features.

## Design Decisions
  * Much like a data grid, Compact Interactive List uses a roving tab stop. When you press **TAB** to focus the Compact Interactive List component, the last visited cell or the first cell upon initial selection becomes active. Focus is moved between cells using keyboard controls or mouse input.
    If you press **TAB** or **SHIFT+TAB** while the Compact Interactive List component is active, you exit the list.
  * The consumer data state is not maintained. The state must be maintained by the consumer.
  * Callbacks are used to communicate user actions.
  The callbacks are provided by the consumer; therefore, the implementation is consumer specific.
  The consumer determines whether actions are performed and what those actions are.
  For example, the user can select a cell in the Compact Interactive List component, which calls the onCellSelect callback.
  * A single interactive element per cell is supported. If more than one interactive component is placed in a cell, the component will not behave as intended.
  * To maintain simple keyboard controls, interactive elements like text input fields, radio button groups, and sliders are not currently supported.

## Accessibility
### Keyboard Interactions

|Keys |Description|
|---|---|
|UP ARROW       | Selects the cell above the currently active cell. If the top cell of a column is active, the last cell of the previous column is selected. If the top cell of the first column is active, the active cell does not change.|
|DOWN ARROW     | Selects the cell below the currently active cell. If the last cell of a column is active, the first cell of the next column is selected. If the last cell of the last column is active, the active cell does not change.|
|RIGHT ARROW    | Selects the cell to the right of the currently active cell. If the right-most cell in the row is active, the active cell does not change.|
|LEFT ARROW     | Selects the cell to the left of the currently active cell. If the left-most cell in the row is active, the active cell does not change.|
|HOME           | Selects the first cell in the active row.|
|END            | Selects the last cell in the active row.|
|CTRL+HOME (Microsoft Windows) <br/> or <br/> CTRL+COMMAND+LEFT ARROW (Apple Mac) | Selects the first cell in the first row.|
|CTRL+END (Microsoft Windows) <br/> or <br/>CTRL+COMMAND+RIGHT ARROW (Apple Mac) | Selects the last cell in the last row.|
|TAB            | Exits the list and moves to the next selectable element in the tab sequence.|
|SHIFT+TAB    | Exits the list and moves to the previous selectable element in the tab sequence.|
|SPACEBAR| Selects the active cell. A cell cannot be selected if it contains active elements in it.|
|ESC| Removes the cell selection.|

### Assistive Technology Support
#### WAI ARIA Roles and States
* [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label)
  * **Compact Interactive List**: When the [ariaLabel](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) property is specified, the screen reader uses the aria-label value as the [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name) for the list.
* [aria-labelledby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby)
  * **Compact Interactive List**: When the [ariaLabelledBy](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) property is specified, the screen reader uses the aria-labelledby value to determine the [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name) for the list.
* [rowheader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/rowheader_role)
  * **Compact Interactive List**: When the [rowHeaderIndex](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) porperty is provided, the screen reader uses the corresponding cell as the header cell for a row, establishing a relationship between it and the other cells in the same row.
* [columnheader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/columnheader_role)
  * **Column**: When the [displayedName](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#column) property is specified, the screen reader uses it to define the header information for the semantic column.

## Implementation

```

## Properties

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="3">

The supported units for width properties are `px`, `em`, and `rem`. 
Ensure that the width units are consistent across all the properties in the same component. The width properties are
[columnMinimumWidth](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table), 
[columnMaximumWidth](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table), 
[width](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#column), 
[minimumWidth](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#column), and 
[maximumWidth](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#column).
Width units that are inconsistent with the rest of the component properties are disregarded.
