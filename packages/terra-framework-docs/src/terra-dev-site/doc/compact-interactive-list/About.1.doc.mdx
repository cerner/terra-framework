## Overview

The `terra-compact-interactive-list` component  provides users a way to render a collection of interactive data in a list format into a single tab stop. The list can be arranged in columns to fit wide space, and the user can navigate between them with the arrow keys.

<FixedWidthColumns />

### Features
Supports:
* Arranging items in columns.
* Fixed and responsive width columns.
* `px`, `em`, and `rem` width units.
* Vertical and horizontal flow.
* Minimum and maximum column width for responsive columns set for all columns, or to each column individually.
* Selectable cells.
* Interactable elements in cells (one per cell).

Refer to the [examples](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#examples) section for detailed demonstration of the features supported by the Search Field.

## Design Decisions

The Compact Interactive List:
  * Supports only one tab stop. When tabbing into the Compact Interactive List, focus will either go to the last visited cell, or the first cell upon initial entry.
  While on the Compact Interactive List, `Tab` or `Shift+Tab` will exit the list.
  * Does not maintain consumer data state. The state must be maintained by the consumer.
  * Uses callbacks to communicate the actions taken by the user.
  The callbacks are provided by the consumer and therefore the implementation is consumer specific.
  It is up to the consumer to determine if and what actions should be taken.
  For example, the user may click on a selectable cell in the Compact Interactive List which calls the _onCellSelect_ callback.
  For business reasons, the consumer may decide not to honor that cell selection and instead does nothing resulting in the the cell not getting selected in the Worklist Data Grid.
  * Supports single interactive element per cell.

## Accessibility
### Keyboard Interactions

List of keyboard interactions supported by Compact Interactive List.

|Key interactions|Description|
|---|---|
|Up Arrow       | Moves focus one cell up. If focus is on the top cell of the visual column, it will move to the last cell of the previous visual column. If focus is on the top cell of the first visual column, focus does not move.|
|Down Arrow     | Moves focus one cell down. If focus is on the bottom cell of the visual column, it will move to the first cell of the next visual column. If focus is on the bottom cell of the last visual column, focus does not move.|
|Right Arrow    | Moves focus one cell to the right. If focus is on the right-most cell in the visual row, focus does not move.|
|Left Arrow     | Moves focus one cell to the left. If focus is on the left-most cell in the visual row, focus does not move.|
|Home           | Moves focus to the first cell in the visual row that contains focus.|
|End            | Moves focus to the last cell in the visual row that contains focus.|
|Control + Home (Windows) <br/> or <br/> Ctrl + Command + Left Arrow (Mac) | Moves focus to the first cell in the first visual row.|
|Control + End (Windows) <br/> or <br/> Ctrl + Command + Right Arrow (Mac) | Moves focus to the last cell in the last visual row.|
|Tab            | Moves focus out of the list to the next focusable element in the tab sequence.|
|Shift + Tab    | Moves focus out of the grid to the previous focusable element in the tab sequence.|
|Space| Selects the focused cell. Cell cannot be selected if it contains focusable elements in it.|
|Escape| Removes the cell selection.|

### Assistive Technology Support
#### WAI ARIA Roles and States
* [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label)
  * **Compact Interactive List**: When the [_ariaLabel_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) prop is specified, the screen reader will use the _aria-label_ as the [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name) for the list.
* [aria-labelledby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby)
  * **Compact Interactive List**: When the [_ariaLabelledBy_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) prop is specified, the screen reader will use the _aria-labelledby_ element to determine the [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name) for the list.
* [rowheader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/rowheader_role)
  * **Compact Interactive List**: When the [_rowHeaderIndex_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table) is provided, the screen reader will use the corresponding cell as the header cell for a row, establishing a relationship between it and the other cells in the same row.
* [columnheader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/columnheader_role)
  * **Column**: When the [_displayedName_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#column) is specified, the screen reader will use it to define as the header information for the semantic column.

## Properties

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="3">

The supported units for width props are `px`, `em`, and `rem`. 
The width units should be consistent across all the props in the same component. That includes:
[_columnMinimumWidth_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table), 
[_columnMaximumWidth_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#compact-interactive-list-props-table), 
[_width_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#column), 
[_minimumWidth_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#column), and 
[_maximumWidth_](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/compact-interactive-list/about#column).
The width units inconsistent with the rest of the component props will be disregarded.
