# Compact Interactive List examples

## Fix width columns

In this example all semantic columns have `width` set to a number. 

* The semantic columns (and hence the visual columns) will always stay the same width and would not grow bigger or shrink to fill up the container width.
* If the screen width is less than the list container, the horizontal scroll will be added.

## Responsive columns

There are two ways to make a sematic column grow:

*  Omitting the `width` in column props will make the semantic column grow to take all available space.
*  Setting the `flexGrow` prop to true with the `width` set to a number of width units (such as `px`, `em`, or `rem`) will also make the column size responsive. In this case the width will be used as a flex basis.

In the following example the middle column has `flexGrow: true` and grows wide to take all width:

<ResponsiveColumns />

To control the minimum and maximum width of flexible width columns, `columnMaximumWidth` and `columnMinimumWidth` props can be determined on a column level.
The whole list has a defaul minimumWidth. Alternatively `minimumWidth` can be passed as a prop.

In following example the middle column has `maximumWidth: 300px` and `minimumWidth: 100px`.

* Once the minimum width has been reached, the horisontal scroll would show up.
* Once the maximum width has been reached, the row stops growing.

## Use width breakpoints to dynamically adjust the number of columns to the screen width

Another way to control the Compact Interactive List column width is to make its parent component take charge of the number of list columns.
Change the width of the screen to see the number of columns change and the width adjust.

## Horizontal Flow

By default the items in a list go from top to bottom before breaking into a new visual column:

<VerticalFlow />

Use `flowHorizontally` prop to change the direction. Items will go from left to right before breaking into a new line:

<HorizontalFlow />

## Use scalable units

The `widthUnit` prop determines the width unit type, such as `px`, `em`, or `rem`. 
Check out the example below to see how the same list looks like when placed within a container with `fontSize: 1.25em` and `widthUnit` prop set to `em`:
