# Terra Filter Pills

Pills are generally used to assign a label or keyword to user interface (UI) objects, defining a non-hierarchal group. They are used to visually label
UI objects for quick recognition. These labels can be generated either by the system or created by users entering data.

When using a filter workflow, which removes items from a view that do not satisfy specific criteria, Filter Pills can provide indication as to which
facet categories and attributes the user can narrow the content by, helping to futher divide content in order to assist users in refining large results.

## What the component is

Filter Pills are comprised of the following:

  - Label ( clickable if truncated to disclose the full label )

  - An optional category to help describe the label

  - An interactive button to remove the filter

## What the component is not

- Although similar, pills and tags have their own use cases and best practices for when they should be used within the UI. See [tags](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/components/terra-tag/tag/tag) for more
information.

- Although the filtering workflow may narrow down content to drive the user's workflow, it should not be used in place of primary or secondary
navigation. See primary navigation and secondary navigation for more information.

## Getting Started

- Install with [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com):
  - `npm install terra-pills`

# Introduction
Filter Pills can be added to a variety of situations and compositions to apply context of the applied categories or labels. They can be constructed
into in various higher-order component patterns like an ʻApplied Filters' toolbar, or locations that the applied categery labels are removable by the
user. They also have the ability to flex layouts between an expanded state showing all filter pills, and a collapsed state showing just a single line
and roll-up toggle to show and hide the additional filter pills.

# How To Construct:

## Filter Pill with a basic Label

Filter Pills in their standard form display a single keyword or short phrase as their label. They are also removeable, which makes them interactive
with the clickable remove ("X") button, as well as by interactive by keyboard, able to be removed by pressing the 'delete' or 'backspace' key when
they are in focus.

<BasicLabelExample title="Basic Filter Pills" />

## Adding the optional Category to the Label

Additional category terms can be added to the single keyword or short phrase label to provide additional clarity in situations where the same
keyword label may appear twice (but apply to different groupings), or is needed to help indicate to a user the category groupings the labels
belong to.

<CategoryLabelExample title="Adding a Label Category" />

## Long Labels & Truncation: Popup Added

In cases where the width of the space is constrained and the text label for the Filter Pill is unable to fully display, a popup will automatically be
added and the label will become an interactive target. Clicking the label will disclose the full Filter Pill text label (and category if applied) as the
contents. No additional content can be added to the popup.

<TruncatedLabelExample title="Selectable Filter Pill Label on Truncation" />

## Adding a Visible Label

Filter Pills are commonly used in a group or list, which must include a label to indicate the intent or purpose of the contents of the list.
Accordingly, the filter pills component requires the `ariaLabel` prop for accessibility minimum standards, to give a screenreader user the proper
context of the list, but it is not visible to users.

For best practice, it is recommended that pills include a visible label, which may need to be styled and positioned according to a specific usage
and should be done so by each consumer. Use the `ariaLabelledBy` prop in Filter Pills, and provide it the ʻidʼ of the visible label or heading, which
will allow for the visible text to be accessibly connected to the pills.

_(Note: see the prop reccomended to set the visible text and the `ariaLabel` prop to the same string values for fallback
protection, even though the `ariaLabelledBy` should override the `ariaLabel` use.)_ [read more](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/pills/accessibility-guide#pill-accesibility-heading)
