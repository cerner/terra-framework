## Changes from version 1 to version 2

Terra Pills was updated to use React-Intl `v5` and drops support for React-Intl `v4` and lower.
Projects consuming Terra Pills version 2 should use React Intl version >= 5.

React-intl V5 no longer exports the `intlShape` consuming project should replace the `intlShape` with `PropTypes.shape()` containing the functions that are utilized by the component. See [doc](https://formatjs.io/docs/intl#the-intl-object) for most complete and up to date intl shape.
