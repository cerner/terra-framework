# Pinned Columns

### Description

The [Table](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/table/about) component defines two types of columns: pinned and overflow.
The pinned columns are aligned to the left of the Worklist Data Grid component and cannot be scrolled.
The overflow section is aligned to the right of pinned columns and scrolls horizontally to reveal each overflow column.
This example demonstrates a table that supports both pinned and overflow columns.


### Required Properties
* **pinnedColumns**: This property is used to specify columns that need to be left-aligned in the grid and stickied.

* **overflowColumns**: This property is used to specify columns that do not need to be stickied and can scroll horizontally.

Columns specified in both properties are rendered in the order that they are provided in.
