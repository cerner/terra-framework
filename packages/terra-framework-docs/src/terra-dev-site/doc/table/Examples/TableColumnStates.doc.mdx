# Column States

### Description
This example demonstrates a [Table](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/table/about) component that supports column states and sorting.
Users can select the column header to select the column, or they can tab to the column header and then press the **SPACEBAR**.
Users can only select columns that are selectable.

The column can display error and sort indicator icons to represent its current state.

### Properties required
**_onColumnSelect_**: When the user selects a column, this callback is called with the columnId of the selected column.

The example below also demonstrates how the consumer can use properties such as hasError and sortIndicator. The hasError property controls whether the column header displays an error indicator and the sortIndicator property displays a sort indicator icon.
