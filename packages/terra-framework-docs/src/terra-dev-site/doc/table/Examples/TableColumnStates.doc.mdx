# Column States and Selection

### Description
This example demonstrates a [Table](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/table/about) that supports column states and sorting.
A column can be selected by clicking on the column header or tabbing to the column header and pressing the Space key on the focused column header.
Only columns that are selectable can be selected.

The Column can display error and sort indicator icons to represent its current state.

### Properties required
* The **_onColumnSelect_** callback prop: When the user selects a column, this callback will be called with the columnId of the selected column.

The below example also demonstrates how properties such as _isSelectable_, _hasError_ and _sortIndicator_ can be provided by the consumer to control if column header is selectable, display error state, and show sort indicator icons respectively.
