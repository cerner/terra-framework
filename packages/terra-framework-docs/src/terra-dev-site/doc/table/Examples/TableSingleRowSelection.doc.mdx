# Table - Single Row Selection

### Description

Row Selection Mode is controlled via a prop and is off by default.
When creating a Table that supports single row selection, the prop has to be explicitly set by the consumer.
This example demonstrates a Table with full support for multiple row selections.
Since the component is an accessible table component, each row selection checkbox is a tab stop.

### Properties required
This example demonstrates a Table with full support for row selection by utilizing the following [Table](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/table/about#properties):
* rowSelectionMode
* onRowSelect

## Row Selection Interactions

|Outcome|Action|
