# Table - Single Row Selection

### Description

Row selection mode is controlled with a property and is off by default.
When creating a table that supports single row selection, the consumer must set the property.
This example demonstrates a table with full support for multiple row selections.
Because the component is an accessible table, each row selection checkbox is a tab stop.

### Required Properties
* rowSelectionMode
