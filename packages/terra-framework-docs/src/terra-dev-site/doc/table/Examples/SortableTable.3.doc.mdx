# Sortable Table

### Description

This example demonstrates a [Table](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/table/about) component with sortable information.
The Table component does not have logic to perform column sorting because knowledge about the column data business logic would be required.
Consumers can enable sorting capabilities by listening to the _onColumnSelect_ callback and properly updating the source data of the table.

### Required Properties
**_onColumnSelect_**: When the user selects a column, this callback is called with the columnId of the selected column.

<SortableTable />
