# Sortable Table

### Description

This example demonstrates a [Table](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/table/about) with the sortable data.
The Table component does not have logic to perform column sorting as knowledge about the column data business logic would be required.
Consumers can enable sorting capabilities by listening to the _onColumnSelect_ callback and properly updating the source data of the Table.

### Properties required
* **_onColumnSelect_**: When the user selects a column, this callback will be called with the columnId of the selected column.

<SortableTable />
