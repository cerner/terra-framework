## Overview
<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="2">
The Terra Slider is an input component used to select an imprecise value within a range such as a zoom level. The component does not currently support entry of precise values.
</Notice>

The Terra Slider component provides a way to select a value from a given range by moving an indicator along a bar to track the value.

<DefaultSlider />

### Features
* Managing a custom slider label, minimum label, and maximum label.
* Setting a default value for the slider.
* Disabling the slider.
* Making other updates based on the slider value changing with the onChange callback property.
* Externally updating the slider value with the value property. Consumers can programmatically change the value of the slider without directly interacting with the element. In most cases, using this feature is not recommended. If you want to use this feature, ensure that the UI clearly indicates that the value was changed and that screen readers can announce the change.

See the [Examples](/components/cerner-terra-framework-docs/slider/about#examples) section for detailed demonstrations of the Slider component features.
