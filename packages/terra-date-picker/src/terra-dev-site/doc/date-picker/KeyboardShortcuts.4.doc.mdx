# Keyboard Shortcuts for Terra Date Picker

The Terra Date Picker offers additional functionality with specific keyboard shortcuts to save time when interacting with date inputs in terra-date-picker.

Pressing any of the supported keys while the input is in focus will populate the inputs with the listed shortcut response.

| Key / Sequence | Description |
|-|-|
| T | Sets the date value to the current date (Today). |
| - | Decrements the date value by 1 day. If blank or not a valid date, input will set value to Yesterday. |
| + | Increments the date value by 1 day. If blank or not a valid date, input will set value to Tomorrow. |

_Note: For any key listed, pressing the designated keyboard character key is not specific to uppercase or lowercase and works for both cases (e.g. if capslock or shift key is also being applied). Uppercase-only usage is not required._

## Release notes for specific versions
