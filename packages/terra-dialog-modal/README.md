# Terra Dialog Modal


[![NPM version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/terra-dialog-modal)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/terra-dialog-modal)
[![Build Status](https://badgen.net/travis/cerner/terra-framework)](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/terra-framework)

The Dialog Modal allows dynamic height modals. It's limited use case, as dynamic heights break with more complicated DOM structures. If content is too complicated, the terra-modal-manager should be used. The components is placed at an 8000 z-index. The dialog supports release and request focus props similar to terra-popup and terra-date-picker, so it can be presented from another modal with focus.
