## Usage

### Implementation Requirements

The SlidePanelManager utilizes the DisclosureManager API to manage disclosure requests. The components provided as children to the SlidePanelManager, and the components disclosed within it, must interface with the SlidePanelManager's context using the `withDisclosureManager()` higher-order component generator provided by the `terra-disclosure-manager` package.

The SlidePanelManager responds to the `"panel"` disclosure type. Components that wish to disclose content using the SlidePanelManager should provide a preferred type of `"panel"`. This value is exported from the package as `disclosureType`. Please see the [DisclosureManager documentation](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/#/components/terra-disclosure-manager/disclosure-manager/about) for a full description of the SlidePanelManager's capabilities.
