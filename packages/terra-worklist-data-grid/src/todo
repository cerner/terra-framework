DONE 1. replaced columns prop with pinned columns and overflows
DONE 2. overflow colums are the "basic" columns
DONE 3. build pinned columns and overflow columns
DONE 4. add horizontal scrolling

DONE 5. add sticky to pinned columns CSS

create a variable/state variable to store pinnedColumnOffsets (an array of the offset for each pinned column)
create an "offset" prop to cells

offsetContext = {
    offset/pinned columns data
}

initialize it on the WDG level

in Cell,

import offsetContext from context

const offsetContext = useContext(offsetContext)

---

what data does the Cell/Row/Header Cell/etc need access to?

- indexes of the pinned columns/length of pinned columns
- indexes/length of overflow columns
- pinned column offsets

Cell needs:
- if the column is pinned or not.

Row needs:
- NOTHING
- only passes through isPinned to the Cells, so it doesn't need info about pinned/overflow columns

ColumnHeader needs:
- NOTHING
- only passes through isPinned to the ColumnHeaderCells, so it doesn't need info about pinned/overflow columns

ColumnHeaderCell needs:
- if the column is pinned or not.
- the column header data to display.

ColumnResizeHandle needs:
- nothing atm.

RowSelectionCell needs:
- not sure yet. needs to be pinned though.

----

ex 3 pinned columns, widths are 5px, 10px, 5px

offset array: [0, 5, 15]

also need to account for row selection cell.

----

future:
DONE 5.1. fix cell selection issue
5.2. Fix resize handle offset/fix being able to resize behind pinned columns

issues:
1. pinned columns are transparent on hover because the background-color is transparent.
2. resize handle can be accessed on overflow columns that are behind pinned columns.

^ both of these are fixed by making the background opaque.

5.3 Keyboard magic <- move to separate Jira

5.4 fix the resize handle disappearing on pinned columns
    -> z-index?

5.5 add border/box shadow to right side of pinned columns.
    Tried:
        - using CSS pseudo-classes (.pinned last-child, last-of-type, first-child, first-of-type) to select the last pinned column.
            this is not possible (CSS limitation, cannot select last of class).
        - adding a second class '.last-pinned' to the last pinned column. this works to apply box shadow, but cannot change
            border style of a cell.

    Other options:
        - create an extra pinned column with a small width and set the 'box shadow' background on it.
        - create a div the width and height of pinned columns with a lower z-index (so it is behind pinned columns) and set box shadow on it.

5.6 validate that row headers are always pinned columns.

5.7 fix rows erroring on undefined since it's an optional prop.

6. fix border issue
7. fix css glitches
8. accessibility (screen reader) testing
9. add tests (jest/wdio)


----

pinned columns and row header cases:

1. pinned columns: [], rowHeaderIndex: 0
    VALID
2. pinned columns: [], rowHeaderIndex: >0
    INVALID
3. pinned columns: [], rowHeaderIndex: <0
    INVALID
4. pinned columns: [1, 2, 3], rowHeaderIndex: 0
    VALID
5. pinned columns: [1, 2, 3], rowHeaderIndex: 2
    VALID
6. pinned columns: [1, 2, 3], rowHeaderIndex: 4
    INVALID

rowHeaderIndex MUST be a positive integer.
