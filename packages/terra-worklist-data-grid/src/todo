DONE 1. replaced columns prop with pinned columns and overflows
DONE 2. overflow colums are the "basic" columns
DONE 3. build pinned columns and overflow columns
DONE 4. add horizontal scrolling

DONE 5. add sticky to pinned columns CSS

create a variable/state variable to store pinnedColumnOffsets (an array of the offset for each pinned column)
create an "offset" prop to cells

offsetContext = {
    offset/pinned columns data
}

initialize it on the WDG level

in Cell,

import offsetContext from context

const offsetContext = useContext(offsetContext)

---

what data does the Cell/Row/Header Cell/etc need access to?

- indexes of the pinned columns/length of pinned columns
- indexes/length of overflow columns
- pinned column offsets

Cell needs:
- if the column is pinned or not.

Row needs:
- NOTHING
- only passes through isPinned to the Cells, so it doesn't need info about pinned/overflow columns

ColumnHeader needs:
- NOTHING
- only passes through isPinned to the ColumnHeaderCells, so it doesn't need info about pinned/overflow columns

ColumnHeaderCell needs:
- if the column is pinned or not.
- the column header data to display.

ColumnResizeHandle needs:
- nothing atm.

RowSelectionCell needs:
- not sure yet. needs to be pinned though.

----

ex 3 pinned columns, widths are 5px, 10px, 5px

offset array: [0, 5, 15]

also need to account for row selection cell.

----

future:
DONE 5.1. fix cell selection issue
5.2. Fix resize handle offset/fix being able to resize behind pinned columns

issues:
1. pinned columns are transparent on hover because the background-color is transparent.
2. resize handle can be accessed on overflow columns that are behind pinned columns.

5.3 Keyboard magic <- move to separate Jira

6. fix border issue
7. fix css glitches
8. accessibility (screen reader) testing
9. add tests (jest/wdio)
