# Validation Events

## Dynamic Validation

The default behavior of *react-final-form* is to dynamically validate, meaning it validates the content while the user is interacting with the form, and when a form loads. To use this behavior, simply use the error key of the meta data passed to an individual form component, and pass it to the error prop of the Terra Field component (TextareaField, InputField, ...), like in the example below.

## Display Validation onSubmit

Forms written with react-final-form are always validated dynamically, but you can delay showing the validation errors until the form is submitted. The meta argument contains an attribute submitFailed that indicates the last submit was a failure. To display errors on validation, set the isInvalid prop equal to meta.submitFailed like in the example below.

## Disable form submission for an invalid form

The form render function contains attributes such as invalid (the form has errors on it) and pristine (the form has not been touched yet by the user) that allow for you to enable and disable the submission button. All you need to do is pass in the attribute you wish to check in order to see if the button should be enabled or not.

Consult [react-final-form](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form) for further functionality that can be used.
