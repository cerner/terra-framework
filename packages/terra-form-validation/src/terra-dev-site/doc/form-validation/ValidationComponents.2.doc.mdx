# Component Setup

## InputFields and TextareaFields

Setting up InputFields and TextareaFields is very simple. Encapsulate the desired field inside of a react-final-form Field component like down below. Ensure that the render function contains input and meta in it's props hash, and that the appropriate elements from the meta prop is passed into error and isInvalid.

## CheckboxField and RadioFields

For CheckboxField and RadioField, it's recommended to use the field component provided by terra-form-checkbox and terra-form-radio. They contain props for rendering the error message in a consistent manner.

In the Form render function, ensure that you have the errors prop set in the prop hash. Then set the error and isInvalid states based on the information from that hash.

For each individual Radio or Checkbox, encapsulate that component inside of a react-final-form Field element, using the same name and validate function for each control you wish for the field to contain.
**Note:** For having checkboxes that have multiple values, be sure to attach the [] to the name of the Field.

## DatePicker

The DatePicker can be used as well with react-final-form. One thing to note is that the onChange function for a DatePicker doesn't store the value on the event object, as that isn't a native input. For your onChange function, be sure that you use both event and value arguments that are returned, and that the onChange function for react-final-form uses the value argument. Finally, a field is not provided with the DatePicker, so it's recommended to combine terra-date-picker with terra-form-field.

## Examples
