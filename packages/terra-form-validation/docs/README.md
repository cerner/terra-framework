# Form Validation

Terra recommends using [react-final-form](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form) to write from validations for components. This package contains several different hooks and functionality for performing validations at various levels which include:

- Validating onChange
- Validating onSubmit
- Validating Synchronously (Such as for unique user name implementations)
- Restricting inputs to a particular format.

For other functionality that is provided, consult [react-final-form documentation](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form).
