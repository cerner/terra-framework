# Terra Theme Provider


[![NPM version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/terra-theme-provider)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/terra-theme-provider)
[![Build Status](https://badgen.net/travis/cerner/terra-framework)](https://travis-ci.com/cerner/terra-framework)

The theme provider component provides a theme to Terra UI components via CSS custom properties a.k.a CSS variables. This is accomplished by setting a CSS class, generated from the `themeName` prop, which contains defined CSS custom properties for the specified theme on the `html` element.

*Note:* The CSS custom properties applied via the theme provider only work in browsers which have native support for CSS custom properties.
