# Terra Date Time Picker


[![NPM version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/terra-date-time-picker)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/terra-date-time-picker)
[![Build Status](https://badgen.net/travis/cerner/terra-framework)](https://travis-ci.com/cerner/terra-framework)

The DateTimePicker component has a date picker for selecting date and a time input for entering time. DateTimePicker supports the Spring and Fall daylight saving time changes. A date and time can be expressed in many [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) formats. To reduce confusion and complexity, the date time props in DateTimePicker must be expressed in a specific format of the ISO 8601 representation of the date time. That is, any date time prop must conform to the `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss` format.
