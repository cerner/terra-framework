# Terra Date Time Picker

## Events
terra-date-time-picker has several callback events that are slightly different in behavior from the native counterparts.

### onBlur
* The `onBlur` callback prop is triggered only when the entire component loses focus. If the focus is moved from the date input to the time input, the `onBlur` event will not be triggered since the focus is still within the DateTime Picker component. The `onBlur` event would be triggered when the focus is moved to any element that is not a child node of the DateTime Picker.
* There are two paramters in the `onBlur` callback prop. The first parameter is the `event` object representing the blur event. The second parameter is the `options` object that contains the following attributes to describe the current state of the input values at the time when the component loses focus.
  * `iSO` - The date/time value in the ISO format. This attribute would be empty if the date/time value is either empty or is not a complete date time. That is, the ISO string is available only if the isCompleteValue attribute is true.
  * `inputValue` - The face up value in the date and time inputs. If both the date and time have a value, these values will be separated by an white space.
  * `isCompleteValue` - A boolean to indicate whether or not both the date and time values are filled out and conforms to the date/time format. If this boolean is false, the iSO attribute would be empty.
  * `isValidValue` - A boolean to indicate whether or not the complete date/time value is within the range of the minDate and maxDate props and is not an excluded date.

### onChange
* The `onChange` callback prop is triggered only when both a valid date and time that conform to the format is entered directly in the date and time inputs or selected from the date picker. The `onChange` callback prop would not be triggered if the entered or selected date meets one of the following criteria.
 - An exlcuded date in the `excludeDates` prop.
 - A date that is filtered by the `filterDate` prop.
 - Not an included date in the `includeDates` prop.
 - Not within the range of the `minDate` and `maxDate` props.

### onChangeRaw
* The `onChangeRaw` callback prop is triggered whenever any key is entered in the date input. If the entered value happens to be a valid date and time, both the `onChangeRaw` and `onChange` events will be triggered. The `onChangeRaw` event would be triggered first followed by the `onChange` event.

### onClickOutside
* The `onClickOutside` callback prop is triggered when clicking anywhere outside of the date picker to dismiss it.

### onFocus
* The `onFocus` callback prop is triggered when the component initially gains focus. If the focus is moved from the date input to the time input, the `onFocus` event will not be triggered since the focus is still within the DateTime Picker component. Similar to the `onBlur` event, the `onFocus` event does not get triggered when the focus is moved from one child node of the DateTime Picker component to another child node of the same DateTime Picker component.

### onSelect
* The `onSelect` callback prop is triggered when a date is selected from the date picker. Once a date is selected, the `onChange` event will be triggered first (if the newly selected is different from the previous date) followed by the `onSelect` event.

## Event Trigger Order
When these actions are taken, the events are triggered in the following order.
* Manual date entry 
    1. onChangeRaw
    2. onChange (if the entered date and time are valid.)
* Selection from the picker
    1. onSelect
    2. onChange (if the existing time is valid which now forms a complete date time value.)
