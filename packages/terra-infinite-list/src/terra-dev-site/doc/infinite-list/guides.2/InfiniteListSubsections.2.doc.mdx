# Terra InfiniteList - Subsections

To achieve sections within the InfiniteList the only supported implementation is directly consuming the static variant of the `SectionHeader` and `SubsectionHeader` component. Expand/collapse functionality is not supported within the infinite list. 

## Map Section Structure
So in our first step a `SectionHeader` needs to be created for each associated section. We'll add it to the initialization of an array that will be expanded in the following steps.
```jsx
  const createSection = (sectionData) => {
    const section = [
      <SectionHeader
        key={sectionData.key}
        title={sectionData.title}
      />,
    ];
    return section;
  };
```
Next we'll create an array with the first item being our section header, and then loop through the associated child sub sections for the section appending them to the initial array.
```jsx
  const createSection = (sectionData) => {
    const section = [
      <SectionHeader
        key={sectionData.key}
        title={sectionData.title}
      />,
    ];
    sectionData.childItems.forEach(childItem => section.push(createSection(childItem)));
    return section;
  };
```
## Map Subsection Structure
So in our first step a `SubsectionHeader` needs to be created for each associated section. We'll add it to the initialization of an array that will be expanded in following steps.
```jsx
const createSubSection = (subsectionData) => {
  const section = [
    <SubsectionHeader
      key={subsectionData.key}
      title={subsectionData.title}
    />,
  ];
  return section;
};
```
Next we'll create an array with the first item being our subsection header, and then loop through the associated child items for the section appending them to the initial array.
```jsx
const createSubSection = (subsectionData) => {
  const section = [
    <SubsectionHeader
      key={subsectionData.key}
      title={subsectionData.title}
    />,
  ];
  subsectionData.childItems.forEach(childItem => section.push(createListItem(childItem)));
  return section;
};
```
## Unpack Data
We can then implement the unpack of our data into our list items.
```jsx
const createListItem = itemData => (
  <Item key={itemData.key}>
    <Placeholder title={itemData.title} />
  </Item>
);

const createSections = data => data.map(section => createSection(section));
```
Then we can implement a method to loop through our data and create the section with our methods and call it from our render method.
```jsx
const InfiniteListSection = () => (
  <MyExampleContainer>
    <InfiniteList
      dividerStyle="standard"
      isFinishedLoading
    >
      {createSections(mockData)}
    </InfiniteList>
  </MyExampleContainer>
);
```

Using these steps we get the following example:

## Example
<InfiniteListSubsection title='Sections Header Infinite List' />
