# focus-trap-react [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davidtheclark/focus-trap-react.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davidtheclark/focus-trap-react)

A React component that traps focus.

This component is a light wrapper around [focus-trap](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap),
tailored to your React-specific needs.

You might want it for, say, building [an accessible modal](https://github.com/davidtheclark/react-aria-modal)?

## What it does

[Check out the demo](http://davidtheclark.github.io/focus-trap-react/demo/).

Please read [the focus-trap documentation](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap) to understand what a focus trap is, what happens when a focus trap is activated, and what happens when one is deactivated.

This module simply provides a React component that creates and manages a focus trap.

- The focus trap automatically activates when mounted (by default, though this can be changed).
- The focus trap automatically deactivates when unmounted.
- The focus trap can be activated and deactivated, paused and unpaused via props.

## Installation

```
npm install focus-trap-react
```

`dist/focus-trap-react.js` is the Babel-compiled file that you'll use.

### React dependency

Version 2+ is compatible with React >0.14+.

Version 1 is compatible with React 0.13.

## Browser Support

Basically IE9+.

Why? Because this module's core functionality comes from focus-trap, which uses [a couple of IE9+ functions](https://github.com/davidtheclark/tabbable#browser-support).

## Usage

You wrap any element that you want to act as a focus trap with the `<FocusTrap>` component. `<FocusTrap>` expects exactly one child element which can be any HTML element or other React component that contains focusable elements.

For example:

```js
<FocusTrap>
  <div id="modal-dialog" className="modal" >
    <button>Ok</button>
    <button>Cancel</button>
  </div>
</FocusTrap>
```

```js
<FocusTrap>
  <ModalDialog okButtonText="Ok" cancelButtonText="Cancel" />
</FocusTrap>
```

You can read further code examples in `demo/` (it's very simple), and [see how it works](http://davidtheclark.github.io/focus-trap-react/demo/).

Here's one more simple example:

```js
const React = require('react');
const ReactDOM = require('react-dom');
const FocusTrap = require('../../dist/focus-trap-react');

const container = document.getElementById('demo-one');

class DemoOne extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      activeTrap: false
    };

    this.mountTrap = this.mountTrap.bind(this);
    this.unmountTrap = this.unmountTrap.bind(this);
  }

  mountTrap() {
    this.setState({ activeTrap: true });
  }

  unmountTrap() {
    this.setState({ activeTrap: false });
  }

  render() {
    const trap = this.state.activeTrap
      ? <FocusTrap
          focusTrapOptions={{
            onDeactivate: this.unmountTrap
          }}
        >
          <div className="trap">
            <p>
              Here is a focus trap
              {' '}
              <a href="#">with</a>
              {' '}
              <a href="#">some</a>
              {' '}
              <a href="#">focusable</a>
              {' '}
              parts.
            </p>
            <p>
              <button onClick={this.unmountTrap}>
                deactivate trap
              </button>
            </p>
          </div>
        </FocusTrap>
      : false;

    return (
      <div>
        <p>
          <button onClick={this.mountTrap}>
            activate trap
          </button>
        </p>
        {trap}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<DemoOne />, container);
```

### Props

#### focusTrapOptions

Type: `Object`, optional

Pass any of the options available in [`focus-trap`'s `createOptions`](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap#focustrap--createfocustrapelement-createoptions).

#### active

Type: `Boolean`, optional

By default, the `FocusTrap` activates when it mounts. So you activate and deactivate it via mounting and unmounting. If, however, you want to keep the `FocusTrap` mounted *while still toggling its activation state*, you can do that with this prop.

See `demo/demo-three.jsx`.

#### paused

Type: `Boolean`, optional

If you would like to pause or unpause the focus trap (see [`focus-trap`'s documentation](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap#focustrappause)), toggle this prop.
