# ApplicationBase

The ApplicationBase component is the entrypoint into the Terra application framework. Applications must render ApplicationBase around the their content to provide the content with ApplicationBase's features.

> ApplicationBase renders the Base component (from `terra-base`) around its children. Components rendered within ApplicationBase should not render a separate Base instance.

## Usage

```jsx
import ApplicationBase from 'terra-application/lib/application-base';
```

## Props

<PropsTable />

## Features

### I18n

ApplicationBase exposes a prop to define the application's locale and dynamically retrieve the translated strings for that locale. Children of ApplicationBase can access translated strings by using [react-intl's](https://github.com/formatjs/formatjs/blob/master/website/docs/react-intl/components.md) provided components or by using the [ApplicationIntlContext](/application/terra-application/contexts/application-intl-context).

Consumers of ApplicationBase should review Terra's [translation aggregation](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/guides/terra-ui/internationalization/aggregate-translations) instructions to ensure ApplicationBase can retrieve the application's translations successfully.

### Theming

ApplicationBase exposes props to define the application's theme.

ApplicationBase renders a theme context provider around its children. Children can access the current theme by using the [ThemeContext](/application/terra-application/contexts/theme-context).

<!-- Consumers of ApplicationBase should review Terra's [theme aggregation](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit-boneyard/blob/main/scripts/aggregate-themes/README.md) instructions to ensure the all theme properties are loaded appropriately. -->

### Breakpoints

ApplicationBase renders an [ActiveBreakpointContext.Provider](/application/terra-application/contexts/active-breakpoint-context) around its children. Children can access the current active breakpoint value by using the [ActiveBreakpointContext](/application/terra-application/contexts/active-breakpoint-context).

### Exception Handling

ApplicationBase renders an [ApplicationErrorBoundary](/application/terra-application/components/application-error-boundary) around its children. If the children throw exceptions during React lifecycle functions, ApplicationBase will catch the exceptions and render a styled error component in place of the children.

### Loading Overlays

ApplicationBase renders an [ApplicationLoadingOverlayProvider](/application/terra-application/components/application-loading-overlay-provider) around its children. Any [ApplicationLoadingOverlay](/application/terra-application/components/application-loading-overlay) components rendered by children will result in loading overlays being rendered by ApplicationBase.

### Status Views

ApplicationBase renders an [ApplicationStatusOverlayProvider](/application/terra-application/components/application-status-overlay-provider) around its children. Any [ApplicationStatusOverlay](/application/terra-application/components/application-status-overlay) components rendered by children will result in a status view being rendered by ApplicationBase.

### Unsaved Changes

ApplicationBase monitors its children for the presence of rendered [NavigationPrompts](/application/terra-application/components/navigation-prompt). ApplicationBase will prompt the user, if possible, using a browser-native confirmation dialog prior to any window unload event if any [NavigationPrompts](/application/terra-application/components/navigation-prompt) are rendered at the time of the unload request.

> Note that support for the `beforeunload` event used to implement this functionality varies across terra-application's supported browsers. Some browsers, namely those running on iOS and Android, do not support the `beforeunload` event and do not allow the framework to prevent the application's dismissal, even if unsaved changes are present. Other browsers allow their users to explicitly disable this event to avoid malicious or otherwise obtrusive implementations.
Please review the [event's documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onbeforeunload#Browser_compatibility) for more information.

### Code Splitting

ApplicationNavigation renders a [Suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) component around its children. If any child components or their descendants are lazy loaded using [React.lazy](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy), a sensible fallback will be rendered while the component is being retrieved. The fallback will render below the ApplicationNavigation header and allow the header to remain interactable.

### Modal Presentation

ApplicationBase renders a [ModalManager](/application/terra-application/components/modal-manager) around its children. Children can access modal disclosure APIs by using the [DisclosureManagerContext](/application/terra-application/contexts/disclosure-manager-context).
