[**rehype**][rehype] plugin to add `id`s to headings.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-slug
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `fragment.html`:

```html
<h1>Lorem ipsum ðŸ˜ª</h1>
<h2>dolorâ€”sitâ€”amet</h2>
<h3>consectetur &amp; adipisicing</h3>
<h4>elit</h4>
<h5>elit</h5>
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var rehype = require('rehype')
var slug = require('rehype-slug')

rehype()
  .data('settings', {fragment: true})
  .use(slug)
  .process(fs.readFileSync('fragment.html'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```html
<h1 id="lorem-ipsum-">Lorem ipsum ðŸ˜ª</h1>
<h2 id="dolorsitamet">dolorâ€”sitâ€”amet</h2>
<h3 id="consectetur--adipisicing">consectetur &#x26; adipisicing</h3>
<h4 id="elit">elit</h4>
<h5 id="elit-1">elit</h5>
```

## API

### `rehype().use(slug)`

Add `id` properties to h1-h6 headings that donâ€™t already have one.

Uses [**github-slugger**][ghslug] to create GitHub style `id`s.

## Security

Use of `rehype-slug` can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attack as it sets `id` attributes on headings.
In a browser, elements are retrievable by `id` with JavaScript and CSS.
If a user injects a heading that slugs to an `id` you are already using,
the user content may impersonate the website.

Always be wary with user input and use [`rehype-sanitize`][sanitize].
