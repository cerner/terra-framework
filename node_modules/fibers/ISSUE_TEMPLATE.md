<!--
Thank you for reporting an issue about fibers. Please make sure you've read the first section of the README because it contains valuable information about common issues.

Some common issues:

- If you are having problems with an odd-numbered version of nodejs please try again with an even-numbered version instead. The nodejs team doesn't do a good job of communicating this but odd-numbered versions are basically beta versions.

- If you are having problems with a Meteor project please stop right now and go read their documentation. You most likely are trying to use a version of nodejs that is not supported by Meteor.

- Find the npm version badge on the front page of this project's github. If the version of fibers you're trying to install is not the latest version then please stop and update your dependencies to require the latest version. This often happens when attempting to install another npm module which depends on fibers.

- If your error says "Can't wait without a fiber" then please go read the documentation again. You need a top-level Fiber or Future before calling `wait`.

- If you're using Webpack then don't. Fibers can't be used with Webpack.


If none of these apply then feel free to open a ticket with a bug report or question. PLEASE INCLUDE ENOUGH INFORMATION IN YOUR REPORT. You are a software engineer! Ask yourself: "if someone was reporting an issue about something that I wrote what information would be helpful?". That is, please include your nodejs version, your operating system version, your compiler version, what you've tried so far to fix the issue.. things like that. If some specific code is triggering the issue then please include a full example of the code that can be run on its own. Please no "snippets", if I can't run the code without modifications then I can't help you.
